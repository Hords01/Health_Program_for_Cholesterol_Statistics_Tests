## ðŸ“š Project Summary

A health program was designed for cholesterol patients to monitor the effectiveness of lifestyle changes over time. During the program, various metrics were recorded, including:

- **Age**
- **Weight** (before and after the program)
- **Cholesterol levels** (initial, 3rd month, and after the program)
- **Average glucose levels** (during the program)

## ðŸ§ª Statistical Questions (Î± = 0.05)

This study aims to answer the following questions using appropriate statistical hypothesis tests:

1. Does the health program significantly change cholesterol levels?
2. Is there a significant difference in glucose levels between genders?
3. Does the health program significantly change participants' weight?
4. Is there a significant difference in glucose levels across age groups?
5. Is there a significant difference in the average ages of female and male patients?
6. Does the program significantly change cholesterol levels for **women**?
7. Does the program significantly change cholesterol levels for **men**?
8. Does the program significantly change **womenâ€™s** weight?
9. Does the program significantly change **menâ€™s** weight?
