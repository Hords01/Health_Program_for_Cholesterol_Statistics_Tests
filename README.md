-> This is a homework of basic statistical algorithms given by Asst. Prof. EDA OZKUL
-> The teacher of this class created this dataset

## Summary
 A researcher is organizing a health program for the treatment of cholesterol patients.
 Within the scope of the program, the researcher records the patients
 age, weight (before and after the program),
 cholesterol levels (before the program, at the 3rd month of the program, and after the program),
 and glucose levels (average throughout the program).

## Answer the questions listed below based on this information.(Take 𝛼 = 0.05.)
 1.Test whether the health program has changed cholesterol levels.
 2.Test whether there is a significant difference in glucose values by gender.
 3.Test whether the health program has changed the patients' weights.
 4.Test whether there is a significant difference in glucose values among patients based on age categories.
 5.Test whether there is a significant difference in the average ages of female and male patients.
 6.Test whether the health program has changed women's cholesterol levels.
 7.Test whether the health program has changed men's cholesterol levels.
 8.Test whether the health program has changed female patients weights.
 9.Test whether the health program has changed male patients weights.


## Explanations for the variables in the dataset:
 ->gender:
    Female: 1
    Male: 2
## ->cat_age(categorical age):
   Those who are 40 years old or younger: 1
   Those in the 41-50 age range: 2
   Those in the 51-70 age range: 3
   Those who are 71 years old or older: 4
 ->kg_before: The participants weights before the program.
 ->kg_after: The participants weights after the program.
 ->cho_init: The participants' cholesterol levels before the program.(initial)
 ->cho_3mo: The participants' cholesterol levels at the 3rd month of the program.
 ->cho_6mo: The participants' cholesterol levels at the end of the program.
 ->glucose: The participants' average glucose values throughout the program.
